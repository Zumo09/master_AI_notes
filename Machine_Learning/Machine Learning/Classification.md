# Classification

# Supervised Classification

We want to learn how to guess the value of the *D-th* attribute for some items which have not been examined by experts, we want a ***classification model***

## Classification Model

An algorithm which, given an individual for which the class is not known, compute the class.

- choose the learning algorithm
- let the algorithm learn its parametrization
- assess the quality of the classification model

## Two flavors for classification

- Crisp: assign to each individual *one label*
- Probabilistic: assign a *probability for each of the possible label*

# Decision Tree

Entropy, Information Gain, Overfitting, Gini Index

[Classification with Decision Tree](Classification/Classification%20with%20Decision%20Tree.md)

# Evaluation of a Classifier

Holdout, Cross Validation, Accuracy and other measures, Confusion Matrix, Lift charts, ROC curves, OVO, OVA, Ensemble methods
