[Data Types](Data/Data%20Types.csv)

## Relational Table

The set of attributes is the same for all the records, a row is an individual, a column is a property.

## Data Matrix

Relational table with all numerical attributes. Each row is a point in a vector space

## Transactional data

Each record contains a set of objects

## Graph data

Web pages with molecular structure. Set of nodes and oriented arcs

## Ordered data

Spatial, temporal, sequence of objects or events, genetic bases

# Data quality

## Noise

Modification of original values. Uninteresting mixed to the interesting data

## Outliers

Data whose characteristics are considerably different from most of the data in the dataset, generated by noise or rare events

## Missing Values

Data not collected or information not applicable

Can be managed by:

- Do not consider objects with missing values
- estimate/default
- Ignore
- Insert all the possible values, weighted with probabilities√π

## Duplicates data

Major issue when merging data from different sources

Data Cleaning is the process of dealing with duplicated/inconsistent data
